--- abstract

This document describes Post Sockets, an asynchronous abstract programming
interface for the atomic transmission of messages in an inherently multipath
environment. Post replaces connections with long-lived associations between
endpoints, with the possibility to cache cryptographic state in order to
reduce amortized connection latency. We present this abstract interface as an
illustration of what is possible with present developments in transport
protocols when freed from the strictures of the current sockets API.

# Introduction

The BSD Unix Sockets API's SOCK_STREAM abstraction, by bringing network
sockets into the UNIX programming model, allowing anyone who knew how to write
programs that dealt with sequential-access files to also write network
applications, was a revolution in simplicity. It would not be an overstatement
to say that this simple API is the reason the Internet won the protocol wars
of the 1980s. SOCK_STREAM is tied to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
specified in 1981 {{RFC0793}}. TCP has scaled remarkably well over the past
three and a half decades, but its total ubiquity has hidden an uncomfortable
fact: the network is not really a file, and stream abstractions are too
simplistic for many modern application programming models.

In the meantime, the nature of Internet access, and the variety of Internet
transport protocols, is evolving. The challenges that new protocols and access
paradigms present to the sockets API and to programming models based on them
inspire the design elements of a new approach.

Many end-user devices are connected to the Internet via multiple interfaces,
which suggests it is time to promote the paths by which two endpoints are
connected to each other to a first-order object. While implicit multipath
communication is available for these multihomed nodes in the present Internet
architecture with the Multipath TCP extension (MPTCP) {{RFC6824}}, MPTCP was
specifically designed to hide multipath communication from the application for
purposes of compatibility. Since many multihomed nodes are connected to the
Internet through access paths with widely different properties with respect to
bandwidth, latency and cost, adding explicit path control to MPTCP's API would
be useful in many situations.

Another trend straining the traditional layering of the transport stack
associated with the SOCK_STREAM interface is the widespread interest in
ubiquitous deployment of encryption to guarantee confidentiality,
authenticity, and integrity, in the face of pervasive surveillance
{{RFC7258}}. Layering the most widely deployed encryption technology,
Transport Layer Security (TLS), strictly atop TCP (i.e., via a TLS library
such as OpenSSL that uses the sockets API) requires the encryption-layer
handshake to happen after the transport-layer handshake, which increases
connection setup latency on the order of one or two round-trip times, an
unacceptable delay for many applications. Integrating cryptographic state
setup and maintenance into the path abstraction naturally complements efforts
in new protocols (e.g. QUIC {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}) to
mitigate this strict layering.

To meet these challenges, we present the Post-Sockets Application Programming
Interface (API), described in detail in this work. Post is designed to be
language, transport protocol, and architecture independent, allowing
applications to be written to a common abstract interface, easily ported among
different platforms, and used even in environments where transport protocol
selection may be done dynamically, as proposed in the IETF's Transport Services
working group.

Post replaces the traditional SOCK_STREAM abstraction with a Message
abstraction, which can be seen as a generalization of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol's {{RFC4960}} SOCK_SEQPACKET service. Messages are sent
and received on Carriers, which logically group Messages for transmission and
reception. For backward compatibility, bidirectional byte stream protocols are
represented as a pair of Messages, one in each direction, that can only be marked
complete when the sending peer has finished transmitting data.

Post replaces the notions of a socket address and connected
socket with an Association with a remote endpoint via set of Paths.
Implementation and wire format for transport protocol(s) implementing the Post
API are explicitly out of scope for this work; these abstractions need not map
directly to implementation-level concepts, and indeed with various amounts of
shimming and glue could be implemented with varying success atop any
sufficiently flexible transport protocol.

The key features of Post as compared with the existing sockets API are:

- Explicit Message orientation, with framing and atomicity guarantees for
  Message transmission.

- Asynchronous reception, allowing all receiver-side interactions to be
  event-driven.

- Explicit support for multistreaming and multipath transport protocols and
  network architectures.

- Long-lived Associations, whose lifetimes may not be bound to underlying
  transport connections. This allows associations to cache state and
  cryptographic key material to enable fast resumption of communication, and for
  the implementation of the API to explicitly take care of connection establishment
  mechanics such as connection racing {{RFC6555}} and peer-to-peer rendezvous
  {{RFC5245}}.

- Transport protocol stack independence, allowing applications to be written
  in terms of the semantics best for the application's own design, separate
  from the protocol(s) used on the wire to achieve them. This enables
  applications written to a single API to make use of transport protocols in
  terms of the features they provide, as in {{I-D.ietf-taps-transports}}.

This work is the synthesis of many years of Internet transport protocol
research and development. It is inspired by concepts from the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{RFC4960}}, TCP Minion {{I-D.iyengar-minion-protocol}},
and MinimaLT {{MinimaLT}}, among other transport protocol
modernization efforts. We present Post as an illustration of what is
possible with present developments in transport protocols when freed from the
strictures of the current sockets API. While much of the work for building
parts of the protocols needed to implement Post are already ongoing in other
IETF working groups (e.g. MPTCP, QUIC, TLS), we argue that an abstract
programming interface unifying access all these efforts is necessary to fully
exploit their potential.

{: #fig-abstractions title="Abstractions and relationships in Post Sockets"}

Post is based on a small set of abstractions, centered around a Message Carrier
as the entry point for an application to the networking API.
The relationships among them are shown in Figure {{fig-abstractions}} and detailed in this section.

## Message Carrier {#carrier}

A Message Carrier (or simply Carrier) is a transport protocol stack-independent
interface for sending and receiving messages between an application and a remote
endpoint; it is roughly analogous to a socket in the present sockets API.

Sending a Message over a Carrier is driven by the application, while receipt
is driven by the arrival of the last packet that allows the Message to be
assembled, decrypted, and passed to the application. Receipt is therefore
asynchronous; given the different models for asynchronous I/O and concurrency
supported by different platforms, it may be implemented in any number of ways.
The abstract API provides only for a way for the application to register
how it wants to handle incoming messages.

All the Messages sent to a Carrier will be received on the
corresponding Carrier at the remote endpoint, though not necessarily
reliably or in order, depending on Message properties and the underlying
transport protocol stack.

A Carrier that is backed by current transport protocol stack state
(such as a TCP connection; see {{transient}}) is said to be "active": messages
can be sent and received over it. A Carrier can also be "dormant":
there is long-term state associated with it (via the underlying Association;
see {{association}}), and it may be able to reactivated, but messages cannot
be sent and received immediately.

If supported by the underlying transport protocol stack, a Carrier may
be forked: creating a new Carrier associated with a new
Carrier at the same remote endpoint. The semantics of the usage of multiple Carriers based on the same Association are application-specific. When a Carrier is forked, its corresponding Carrier at the remote
endpoint receives a fork request, which it must accept in order to fully
establish the new carrier. Multiple Carriers between endpoints are
implemented differently by different transport protocol stacks, either using
multiple separate transport-layer connections, or using multiple streams of
multistreaming transport protocols.

To exchange messages with a given remote endpoint, an application may initiate
a Carrier given its remote (see {{remote}} and local (see {{local}})
identities; this is an equivalent to an active open. There are four special
cases of Carriers, as well, supporting different initiation and
interaction patterns, defined in the subsections below.

 - Listener:
   A Listener is a special case of Message Carrier which only responds to
   requests to create a new Carrier from a remote endpoint, analogous to a server
   or listening socket in the present sockets API. Instead of being bound to a
   specific remote endpoint, it is bound only to a local identity; however, its
   interface for accepting fork requests is identical to that for fully fledged
   Carriers.

 - Source:
   A Source is a special case of Message Carrier over which messages can only be
   sent, intended for unidirectional applications such as multicast transmitters.
   Sources cannot be forked, and need not accept forks.

 - Sink:
   A Sink is a special case of Message Carrier over which messages can only
   be received, intended for unidirectional applications such as multicast
   receivers. Sinks cannot be forked, and need not accept forks.

 - Responder:
   A Responder is a special case of Message Carrier which may receive messages
   from many remote sources, for cases in which an application will only ever
   send Messages in reply back to the source from which a Message was received.
   This is a common implementation pattern for servers in client-server
   applications. A Responder's receiver gets a Message, as well as a Source to
   send replies to. Responders cannot be forked, and need not accept forks.

## Message

A Message is the unit of communication between applications. Messages
can represent relatively small structures, such as requests in a
request/response protocol such as HTTP; relatively large
structures, such as files of arbitrary size in a filesystem; and structures of
indeterminate length, such as a stream of bytes in a protocol like TCP.

In the general case, there is no mapping between a Message and packets sent by
the underlying protocol stack on the wire: the transport protocol may freely
segment messages and/or combine messages into packets. However, a message may be
marked as immediate, which will cause it to be sent in a single packet when
possible.

Content may be sent and received either as Complete or Partial Messages.
Dealing with Complete Messages should be preferred for simplicity whenever
possible based on the underlying protocol. It is always possible to send Complete
Messages, but only protocols that have a fixed maximum message length may
allow clients to receive Messages using an API that guarantees Complete Messages.
Sending and receiving Partial Messages (that is, a Message whose content spans multiple
calls or callbacks) is always possible.

To send a Message, either Complete or Partial, the Message content is passed into the
Carrier, and client provides a set of callbacks to know when the Message was delivered or
acknowledged. The client of the API may use the callbacks to pace the sending of
Messages.

To receive a Message, the client of the API schedules a completion to be called when
a Complete or Partial Message is available. If the client is willing to accept Partial Messages,
it can specify the minimum incomplete Message length it is willing to receive at once,
and the maximum number of bytes it is willing to receive at once. If the client wants
Complete Messages, there are no values to tune. The scheduling of the receive completion
indicates to the Carrier that there is a desire to receive bytes, effectively creating a "pull
model" in which backpressure may be applied if the client is not receiving Messages
or Partial Messages quickly enough to match the peer's sending rate. The Carrier may
have some minimal buffer of incoming Messages ready for the client to read to reduce
latency.

When receiving a Complete Message, the entire content of the Message must
be delivered at once, and the Message is not delivered at all if the full Message
is not received.  This implies that both the sending and receiving endpoint,
whether in the application or the carrier, must guarantee storage for the full
size of a Message.

Partial Messages may be sent or received in several stages, with a handle
representing the total Message being associated with each portion of the
content. Each call to send or receive also indicates whether or not the Message
is now complete. This approach is necessary whenever the size of the
Message does not have a known bound, or the size is too large to process
and hold in memory. Protocols that only present a concept
of byte streams represent their data as single Messages with unknown bounds.
In the case of TCP, the client will receive a single Message in pieces using the
Partial Message API, and that Message will only be marked as complete when
the peer has sent a FIN.

Messages are sent over and received from Message Carriers (see {{carrier}}).

On sending, Messages have properties that allow the application to specify its
requirements with respect to reliability, ordering, priority, idempotence, and
immediacy; these are described in detail below. Messages may also have arbitrary
properties which provide additional information to the underlying transport
protocol stack on how they should be handled, in a protocol-specific way. These
stacks may also deliver or set properties on received messages, but in the
general case a received messages contains only a sequence of ordered bytes.
Message properties include:

 - Lifetime and Partial Reliability:
   A Message may have a "lifetime" -- a wall clock duration before which the
   Message must be available to the application layer at the remote end. If a
   lifetime cannot be met, the Message is discarded as soon as possible. Messages
   without lifetimes are sent reliably if supported by the transport protocol
   stack. Lifetimes are also used to prioritize Message delivery.

   There is no guarantee that a Message will not be delivered after the end of
   its lifetime; for example, a Message delivered over a strictly reliable
   transport will be delivered regardless of its lifetime. Depending on the
   transport protocol stack used to transmit the message, these lifetimes may
   also be signalled to path elements by the underlying transport, so that path
   elements that realize a lifetime cannot be met can discard frames containing
   the Messages instead of forwarding them.

 - Priority:
   Messages have a "niceness" -- a priority among other messages sent over the
   same Carrier in an unbounded hierarchy most naturally represented as a
   non-negative integer. By default, Messages are in niceness class 0, or highest
   priority. Niceness class 1 Messages will yield to niceness class 0 Messages
   sent over the same Carrier, class 2 to class 1, and so on. Niceness may be
   translated to a priority signal for exposure to path elements (e.g. DSCP
   code point) to allow prioritization along the path as well as at the sender and
   receiver. This inversion of normal schemes for expressing priority has a
   convenient property: priority increases as both niceness and lifetime
   decrease. A Message may have both a niceness and a lifetime -- Messages with
   higher niceness classes will yield to lower classes if resource constraints
   mean only one can meet the lifetime.

 - Dependence:
   A Message may have "antecedents" -- other Messages on which it
   depends, which must be delivered before it (the "successor") is delivered.
   The sending transport uses deadlines, niceness, and antecedents, along with
   information about the properties of the Paths available, to determine when to
   send which Message down which Path.

 - Idempotence:
   A sending application may mark a Message as "idempotent" to signal to the
   underlying transport protocol stack that its application semantics make it
   safe to send in situations that may cause it to be received more than once
   (i.e., for 0-RTT session resumption as in TCP Fast Open, TLS 1.3, and QUIC).

 - Immediacy:
   A sending application may mark a Message as "immediate" to signal to the
   underlying transport protocol stack that its application semantics require it to
   be placed in a single packet, on its own, instead of waiting to be combined with
   other messages or parts thereof (i.e., for media transports and interactive
   sessions with small messages).

Senders may also be asynchronously notified of three events on Messages they
have sent: that the Message has been transmitted, that the Message has been
acknowledged by the receiver, or that the Message has expired before
transmission/acknowledgement. Not all transport protocol stacks will support
all of these events.

## Association

An Association contains the long-term state necessary to support
communications between a Local (see {{local}}) and a Remote (see {{remote}})
endpoint, such as trust model information, including pinned public
keys or anchor certificates, cryptographic session resumption parameters,
or rendezvous information. It uses information from the Policy Context
(see {{PolicyContext}}) to constrain the selection of
transport protocols and local interfaces to create Transients (see
{{transient}}) to carry Messages; and information about the paths through the
network available available between them (see {{path}}).

All Carriers are bound to an Association. New Carriers will
reuse an Association if they can be carried from the same Local to the same
Remote over the same Paths; this re-use of an Association may implies the
creation of a new Transient.

Associations may exist and be created without a Carrier. This may be done if
peer cryptographic state such as a pre-shared key is established out-of-band.
Thus, Associations may be created without the need to send application data
to a peer, that is, without a Carrier. Associations are mutable. Association
state may expire over time, after which it is removed from the Association,
and Transients may export cryptographic state to store in an Association as needed.
Moreover, this state may be exported directly into the Association or modified
before insertion. This may be needed to diversify ephemeral Transient keying
material from the longer-term Association keying material.

A primary use of Association state is to allow new Associations and their derived
Carriers to be quickly created without performing in-band cryptographic handshakes.
See {{I-D.kuehlewind-taps-crypto-sep}} for more details about this separation.

## Remote

A Remote represents information required to establish and maintain a
connection with the far end of an Association: name(s), address(es), and
transport protocol parameters that can be used to establish a Transient;
transport protocols to use; trust model information, inherited from the
relevant Association, used to identify the remote on connection establishment;
and so on. Each Association is associated with a single Remote, either explicitly by
the application (when created by the initiation of a Carrier) or a
Listener (when created by forking a Carrier on passive open).

A Remote may be resolved, which results in zero or more Remotes with more
specific information. For example, an application may want to establish a
connection to a website identified by a URL https://www.example.com. This URL
would be wrapped in a Remote and passed to a call to initiate a 
Carrier. The first pass resolution might parse the URL, decomposing it into a
name, a transport port, and a transport protocol to try connecting with. A
second pass resolution would then look up network-layer addresses associated
with that name through DNS, and store any certificates available from DANE.
Once a Remote has been resolved to the point that a transport protocol stack
can use it to create a Transient, it is considered fully resolved.

## Local

A Local represents all the information about the local endpoint necessary to
establish an Association or a Listener: interface, port, and transport
protocol stack information, and, per {{I-D.pauly-taps-transport-security}},
cryptographic identities (certificates and associated private keys) bound to
this endpoint.

## Policy Context {#PolicyContext}

The Policy Context describes preferences for, and restrictions on, how to
configure Transients to support communication between a Local and a Remote
over one or more Paths between endpoints.
For instance, an application may require, or prefer to use, certain features
(see {{I-D.ietf-taps-transports}}) of the transport protocol stacks used by
the Transients underlying the Carrier.
Alternatively, it might also prefer Paths over one interface to those over
another (e.g., WiFi access over LTE when roaming on a foreign LTE network,
due to cost).

These policies are expressed in the Policy Context(s) that are bound to the
Association.
Multiple policy contexts can be active at once.
For example, a system Policy Context can express the administrative preferences
around network interface and protocol selection, while an application Policy Context
expresses preferences for use of different transport services.
Expression of policy contexts and the resolution of conflicts among Policy
Contexts is currently implementation-specific (the Policy API in the NEAT
architecture {{NEAT}} provides an example of how this can be done).

## Transient

A Transient represents a binding between a Carrier and the instance of
the transport protocol stack that implements it. As an Association contains
long-term state for communications between two endpoints, a Transient contains
ephemeral state for a single transport protocol over a single Path at a given
point in time.

A Carrier may be served by multiple Transients at once, e.g. when
implementing multipath communication such that the separate paths are exposed to
the API by the underlying transport protocol stack. Each Transient serves only
one Carrier, although multiple Transients may share the same underlying
protocol stack; e.g. when multiplexing Carriers over streams in a multistreaming
protocol.

Transients are generally not exposed by the API to the application, though
they may be accessible for debugging and logging purposes.

## Path

A Path represents information about a single path through the network used by an
Association, in terms of source and destination network and transport layer
addresses within an addressing context, and the provisioning domain {{RFC7556}}
of the local interface. This information may be learned through a resolution,
discovery, or rendezvous process (e.g. DNS, ICE), by measurements taken by the
transport protocol stack, or by some other path information discovery mechanism.
It is used by the transport protocol stack to maintain and/or (re-)establish
communications for the Association.

The set of available properties is a function of the transport protocol stacks
in use by an association. However, the following core properties are generally
useful for applications and transport layer protocols to choose among paths
for specific Messages:

- Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): the maximum size of an Message's payload
  (subtracting transport, network, and link layer overhead) which will likely
  fit into a single frame. Derived from signals sent by path elements, where
  available, and/or path MTU discovery processes run by the transport layer.
- Latency Expectation: expected one-way delay along the Path. Generally
  provided by inline measurements performed by the transport layer, as opposed
  to signaled by path elements.
- Loss Probability Expectation: expected probability of a loss of any
  given single frame along the Path. Generally provided by inline measurements
  performed by the transport layer, as opposed to signaled by path elements.
- Available Data Rate Expectation: expected maximum data rate along the
  Path. May be derived from passive measurements by the transport layer, or from
  signals from path elements.
- Reserved Data Rate: Committed, reserved data rate for the given
  Association along the Path. Requires a bandwidth reservation service in the
  underlying transport protocol stack.
- Path Element Membership: Identifiers for some or all nodes along the
  path, depending on the capabilities of the underlying network layer protocol
  to provide this.

Path properties are generally read-only. MTU is a property of the underlying
link-layer technology on each link in the path; latency, loss, and rate
expectations are dynamic properties of the network configuration and network
traffic conditions; path element membership is a function of network topology.
In an explicitly multipath architecture, application and transport layer
requirements can be met by having multiple paths with different properties to
select from. Transport protocol stacks can also provide signaling to devices
along the path, but this signaling is derived from information provided to the
Message abstraction.

# Abstract Programming Interface

We now turn to the design of an abstract programming interface to provide a
simple interface to Post's abstractions, constrained by the following design
principles:

- Flexibility is paramount. So is simplicity. Applications must be
given as many controls and as much information as they may need, but they must
be able to ignore controls and information irrelevant to their operation. This
implies that the "default" interface must be no more complicated than BSD
sockets, and must do something reasonable.

- Reception is an inherently asynchronous activity. While the API is
designed to be as platform-independent as possible, one key insight it is
based on is that an Message receiver's behavior in a packet-switched network is
inherently asynchronous, driven by the receipt of packets, and that this
asynchronicity must be reflected in the API. The actual implementation of
receive and event handling will need to be aligned to the method a given
platform provides for asynchronous I/O.

- A new API cannot be bound to a single transport protocol and expect
wide deployment. As the API is transport-independent and may support runtime
transport selection, it must impose the minimum possible set of constraints on
its underlying transports, though some API features may require underlying
transport features to work optimally. It must be possible to implement Post
over vanilla TCP in the present Internet architecture.

The API we design from these principles is centered around a Carrier, which
can be created actively via initiate() or passively via a listen(); the latter
creates a Listener from which new Carriers can be accept()ed.  Messages may be
created explicitly and passed to this Carrier, or implicitly through a
simplified interface which uses default message properties (reliable transport
without priority or deadline, which guarantees ordered delivery over a single
Carrier when the underlying transport protocol stack supports it).

For each connection between a Local and a Remote a new Carrier is created and 
destroyed when the connection is closed. However, a new Carrier may use an existing
Association if present for the requested Local-Remote pair and permitted by the
PolicyContext that can be provided at Carrier initiation. Further the system-wide
PolicyContext can contain more information that determine when to create or destroy
Associations other than at Carrier initiation. E.g. an Association can be created 
at system start, based on the configured PolicyContext or also by a manual action of 
an single application, for Local-Remote pairs that are known to be likely used soon, and 
to pre-establish, e.g., cryptographic context as well as potentially collect current information
about path capabilities. Every time an actual connection with a specific PSI is established between the 
Local and Remote, the Association learns new Path information and stores them. This
information can be used when a new transient is created, e.g. to decide which PSI
to use (to provide the highest probably for a successful connection attempt) or which
PSIs to probe for (first). A Transient is created when an application actually sends a 
Message over a Carrier. As further explained below this step can actually create multiple 
transients for probing or assign a new transient to an already active PSI, e.g. if multi-streaming
is provided and supported for these kind of use on both sides.

## Example Connection Patterns

Here, we illustrate the usage of the API for common connection patterns. Note
that error handling is ignored in these illustrations for ease of reading.

### Client-Server

Here's an example client-server application. The server echoes messages. The
client sends a message and prints what it receives.

The client in {{fig-client}} connects, sends a message, and sets up a receiver
to print messages received in response. The carrier is inactive after the
Initiate() call; the Send() call blocks until the carrier can be activated.

~~~~~~~~
// connect to a server given a remote
func sayHello() {

    carrier := Initiate(local, remote)

    carrier.Send([]byte("Hello!"))
    carrier.Ready(func (msg InMessage) {
        fmt.Println(string([]byte(msg))
        return false
    })
    carrier.Close()
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-client title="Example client"}

The server in {{fig-server}} creates a Listener, which accepts Carriers and passes them to a server. The server echos the content of each message it receives.

~~~~~~~~
// run a server for a specific carrier, echo all its messages
func runMyServerOn(carrier Carrier) {
    carrier.Ready(func (msg InMessage) {
        carrier.Send(msg)
    })
}

// accept connections forever, spawn servers for them
func acceptConnections() {
    listener := Listen(local)
    listener.Accept(func(carrier Carrier) bool {
        go runMyServerOn(carrier)
        return true
    })
}
~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-server title="Example server"}

The Responder allows the server to be significantly simplified, as shown in {{fig-responder}}.

~~~~~~~~
func echo(msg InMessage, reply Sink) {
    reply.Send(msg)
}

Respond(local, echo)
~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-responder title="Example responder"}

### Client-Server with Happy Eyeballs and 0-RTT establishment

The fundamental design of a client need not change at all for happy eyeballs
{{RFC6555}} (selection of multiple potential protocol stacks through connection
racing); this is handled by the Post Sockets implementation automatically. If
this connection racing is to use 0-RTT data (i.e., as provided by TCP Fast Open
{{RFC7413}}, the client must mark the outgoing message as idempotent.

~~~~~~~~
// connect to a server given a remote and send some 0-RTT data
func sayHelloQuickly() {

    carrier := Initiate(local, remote)

    carrier.SendMsg(OutMessage{Content: []byte("Hello!"), Idempotent: true}, nil, nil, nil)
    carrier.Ready(func (msg InMessage) {
        fmt.Println(string([]byte(msg)))
        return false
    })
    carrier.Close()
}
~~~~~~~~

### Peer to Peer with Network Address Translation

In the client-server examples shown above, the Remote given to the Initiate call
refers to the name and port of the server to connect to. This need not be the
case, however; a Remote may also refer to an identity and a rendezvous point for
rendezvous as in ICE {{RFC5245}}. Here, each peer does its own Initiate call
simultaneously, and the result on each side is a Carrier attached to an
appropriate Association.

### Multicast Receiver

A multicast receiver is implemented using a Sink attached to a Local
encapsulating a multicast address on which to receive multicast datagrams. The
following example prints messages received on the multicast address forever.

~~~~~~~~
func receiveMulticast() {
    sink = NewSink(local)
    sink.Ready(func (msg InMessage) {
        fmt.Println(string([]byte(msg)))
        return true
    })
}
~~~~~~~~

### Streams as Incomplete Messages

[EDITOR'S NOTE: write me]

### Association Bootstrapping

Here, we show how Association state may be initialized without a carrier.
The goal is to create a long-term Association from which Carriers may be derived
and, if possible, used immediately. Per {{I-D.pauly-taps-transport-security}},
a first step is to specify trust model constraints, such as pinned public keys
and anchor certificates, which are needed to create Remote connections.

We begin by creating shared security parameters that will be used later for creating
a remote connection.

~~~~~~~~
// create security parameters with a set of trusted certificates
func createParameters(trustedCerts []Certificate) Parameters {
    parameters := Parameters()
    parameters = parameters.SetTrustedCerts(trustedCerts)
    return parameters
}
~~~~~~~~

Using these statically configured parameters, we now show how to create an Association
between a Local and Remote using these parameters.

~~~~~~~~
// create an Association using shared parameters
func createAssociation(local Local, remote Remote, parameters Parameters) Association {
    association := NewAssociation(local, remote, parameters)
    return association
}
~~~~~~~~

We may also create an Association with a pre-shared key configured out-of-band.

~~~~~~~~
// create an Association using a pre-shared key
func createAssociationWithPSK(local Local, remote Remote, parameters Parameters, preSharedKey []byte) Association {
    association := NewAssociation(local, remote, parameters)
    association = association.SetPreSharedKey(preSharedKey)
    return association
}
~~~~~~~~

We now show how to create a Carrier from an existing, pre-configured Association.
This Association may or may not contain shared cryptographic static between the
Local and Remote, depending on how it was configured.

~~~~~~~~
// open a connection to a server using an existing Association and send some data,
// which will be sent early if possible.
func sayHelloWithAssociation(association Association) {
    carrier := association.Initiate()

    carrier.SendMsg(OutMessage{Content: []byte("Hello!"), Idempotent: true}, nil, nil, nil)
    carrier.Ready(func (msg InMessage) {
        fmt.Println(string([]byte(msg)))
        return false
    })
    carrier.Close()
}
~~~~~~~~

## API Dynamics

As Carriers provide the central entry point to Post, they are key to API
dynamics. The lifecycle of a carrier is shown in {{fig-carrier-lc}}. By default
Carriers are created given a Local and a Remote, and management of the
underlying Association done by the API automatically. This Association is
available via the Carrier's Association method, and new Carriers created by the
Association's Initiate method. Once a Carrier has been created with an
appropriate constructor (Initiate, NewSource, or NewSink) it can be deactivated
by the Close method and reactivated by the Activate method. Carriers can also be
created explicitly bound to an Associated created by a call to NewAssociation.

~~~~~~~
                    Initiate(local,remote) -+
                   NewSource(local,remote)  |      +-------Activate()
                            NewSink(local)  |      V            |
Listen(local) --Carrier-> Carrier.Accept() -+-> [Carrier] -> .Close() 
               (listener)                        |    ^
                         +----.Association()-----+    |
                         V                            |
NewAssociation() --Association-> .Initiate() ---------+
~~~~~~~
{: #fig-carrier-lc title="Carrier and Association Life Cycle"}

Access to more detailed information is possible through accessors on Carriers
and Associations, following the relationships shown in {{fig-abstractions}}.
Carriers allow their Transients to be accessed and enumerated, primarily for
logging and debugging purposes; Associations likewise allow their Paths to be
enumerated for access to cached path properties.

An application may have a global PolicyContext, as well as more specific
PolicyContexts to apply to the establishment of a given Association or Carrier

# Implementation Considerations

Here we discuss an incomplete list of API implementation considerations that
have arisen with experimentation with prototype implementations of Post.

## Protocol Stack Instance (PSI)

A PSI encapsulates an arbitrary stack of protocols (e.g., TCP over IPv6,
SCTP over DTLS over UDP over IPv4).  PSIs provide the bridge between the
interface (Carrier) plus the current state (Transients) and the implementation
of a given set of transport services {{I-D.ietf-taps-transports}}.

A given implementation makes one or more possible protocol stacks available
to its applications. Selection and configuration among multiple PSIs is
based on system-level or application policies, as well as on network
conditions in the provisioning domain in which a connection is made.

                transport protocol         establishment
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-psi title="Example Protocol Stack Instances"}

For example, {{fig-psi}}(a) shows a TLS over TCP stack, usable on most
network connections. Protocols are layered to ensure that the PSI provides
all the transport services required by the application.
A single PSI may be bound to multiple Carriers, as shown in
{{fig-psi}}(b): a multi-streaming transport protocol like QUIC or SCTP can
support one carrier per stream. Where multi-streaming transport is not
available, these carriers could be serviced by different PSIs on different
flows. On the other hand, multiple PSIs are bound to a single transient
during establishment, as shown in {{fig-psi}}(c). Here, the losing
PSI in a happy-eyeballs race will be terminated, and the carrier will
continue using the winning PSI.

## Message Framing, Parsing, and Serialization

While some transports expose a byte stream abstraction, most higher level
protocols impose some structure onto that byte stream. That is, the higher
level protocol operates in terms of messages, protocol data units (PDUs),
rather than using unstructured sequences of bytes, with each message being
processed in turn.
Protocols are specified in terms of state machines acting on semantic
messages, with parsing the byte stream into messages being a necessary
annoyance, rather than a semantic concern.
Accordingly, Post Sockets exposes a message-based API to applications as
the primary abstraction. Protocols that deal only in byte streams, such as TCP,
represent their data in each direction as a single, long message. When framing
protocols are placed on top of byte streams, the messages used in the API
represent the framed messages within the stream.

There are other benefits of providing a message-oriented API beyond framing
PDUs that Post Sockets should provide when supported by the underlying
transport. These include:

 - the ability to associate deadlines with messages, for transports that
   care about timing;

 - the ability to provide control of reliability, choosing what messages to
   retransmit in the event of packet loss, and how best to make use of the
   data that arrived;

 - the ability to manage dependencies between messages, when some messages
   may not be delivered due to either packet loss or missing a deadline, in
   particular the ability to avoid (re-)sending data that relies on a previous
   transmission that was never received.

All require explicit message boundaries, and application-level framing of
messages, to be effective. Once a message is passed to Post Sockets, it can
not be cancelled or paused, but prioritization as well as lifetime and
retransmission management will provide the protocol stack with all needed
information to send the messages as quickly as possible without blocking
transmission unnecessarily.  Post Sockets provides this by handling
message, with known identity (sequence numbers, in the simple case),
lifetimes, niceness, and antecedents.

Transport protocols such as SCTP provide a message-oriented API that has
similar features to those we describe. Other transports, such as TCP, do
not. To support a message oriented API, while still being compatible with
stream-based transport protocols, Post Sockets must provide APIs for
parsing and serialising messages that understand the protocol data.  That
is, we push message parsing and serialisation down into the Post Sockets
stack, allowing applications to send and receive strongly typed data
objects (e.g., a receive call on an HTTP Message Carrier should return
an object representing the HTTP response, with pre-parsed status code,
headers, and any message body, rather than returning a byte array that
the application has to parse itself).
This is backwards compatible with existing protocols and APIs, since
the wire format of messages does not change, but gives a Post Sockets
stack additional information to allow it to make better use of modern
transport services.

The Post Sockets approach is therefore to raise the semantic level of the
transport API: applications should send and receive messages in the form of
meaningful, strongly typed, protocol data. Parsing and serialising such
messages should be a re-usable function of the protocol stack instance not
the application.  This is well-suited to implementation in modern systems
languages, such as Swift, Go, Rust, or C++, but can also be implemented
with some loss of type safety in C.

{::comment}
  The paper has an example API in Rust-like syntax. We should probably
  figure out a language-neutral way of specifying the Post Sockets API.
{:/comment}

## Message Size Limitations

Ideally, Messages can be of infinite size. However, protocol stacks and protocol
stack implementations may impose their own limits on message sizing; For
example, SCTP {{RFC4960}} and TLS {{I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} impose record size
limitations of 64kB and 16kB, respectively. Message sizes may also be limited by
the available buffer at the receiver, since a Message must be fully assembled by
the transport layer before it can be passed on to the application layer. Since
not every transport protocol stack implements the signaling necessary to
negotiate or expose message size limitations, these are currently configured out
of band, and are probably best exposed through the policy context.

A truly infinite message service -- e.g. large file transfer where both
endpoints have committed persistent storage to the message -- is probably best
realized as a layer above Post Sockets, and may be added as a new type of
Message Carrier to a future revision of this document.

## Back-pressure

Regardless of how asynchronous reception is implemented, it is important for an
application to be able to apply receiver back-pressure, to allow the protocol
stack to perform receiver flow control. Depending on how asynchronous I/O works
in the platform, this could be implemented by having a maximum number of
concurrent receive callbacks, or by bounding the maximum number of outstanding,
unread bytes at any given time, for example.

## Associations, Transients, Racing, and Rendezvous

As the network has evolved, even the simple act of establishing a
connection has become increasingly complex.  Clients now regularly race
multiple connections, for example over IPv4 and IPv6, to determine which
protocol to use.  The choice of outgoing interface has also become more
important, with differential reachability and performance from multiple
interfaces. Name resolution can also give different outcomes depending on
the interface the query was issued from. Finally, but often most
significantly, NAT traversal, relay discovery, and path state maintenance
messages are an essential part of connection establishment, especially for
peer-to-peer applications.

Post Sockets accordingly breaks communication establishment down into
multiple phases:

 - Gathering Locals

   The set of possible Locals is gathered.
   In the simple case, this merely enumerates the local interfaces and
   protocols, and allocates ephemeral source ports for transients. For
   example, a system that has WiFi and Ethernet and supports IPv4 and IPv6
   might gather four candidate locals (IPv4 on Ethernet, IPv6 on Ethernet,
   IPv4 on WiFi, and IPv6 on WiFi) that can form the source for a transient.

   If NAT traversal is required, the process of gathering locals becomes
   broadly equivalent to the ICE candidate gathering phase {{RFC5245}}.
   The endpoint determines its server reflexive locals (i.e., the
   translated address of a local, on the other side of a NAT) and relayed
   locals (e.g., via a TURN server or other relay), for each interface and
   network protocol. These are added to the set of candidate locals for
   this association.

   Gathering locals is primarily an endpoint local operation, although it
   might involve exchanges with a STUN server to derive server reflexive
   locals, or with a TURN server or other relay to derive relayed locals.
   It does not involve communication with the remote.

 - Resolving the Remote

   The remote is typically a name that
   needs to be resolved into a set of possible addresses that can be used
   for communication. Resolving the remote is the process of recursively
   performing such name lookups, until fully resolved, to return the set
   of candidates for the remote of this association.

   How this is done will depend on the type of the Remote, and can also
   be specific to each local.
   A common case is when the Remote is a DNS name, in which case it is
   resolved to give a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses representing that
   name.
   Some types of remote might require more complex resolution. Resolving
   the remote for a peer-to-peer connection might involve communication
   with a rendezvous server, which in turn contacts the peer to gain
   consent to communicate and retrieve its set of candidate locals, which
   are returned and form the candidate remote addresses for contacting
   that peer.

   Resolving the remote is *not* a local operation. It will involve
   a directory service, and can require communication with the remote to
   rendezvous and exchange peer addresses.
   This can expose some or all of the candidate locals to the remote.

 - Establishing Transients

   The set of candidate locals and the set of candidate remotes are
   paired, to derive a priority ordered set of Candidate Paths that
   can potentially be used to establish a connection.

   Then, communication is attempted over each candidate path, in
   priority order. If there are multiple candidates with the same
   priority, then transient establishment proceeds simultaneously
   and uses the transient that wins the race to be established.
   Otherwise, transients establishment is sequential, paced at a
   rate that should not congest the network.
   Depending on the chosen transport, this phase might involve racing
   TCP connections to a server over IPv4 and IPv6 {{RFC6555}}, or
   it could involve a STUN exchange to establish peer-to-peer UDP
   connectivity {{RFC5245}}, or some other means.

 - Confirming and Maintaining Transients

   Once connectivity has been established, unused resources can be
   released and the chosen path can be confirmed.
   This is primarily required when establishing peer-to-peer connectivity,
   where connections supporting relayed locals that were not required can
   be closed, and where an associated signalling operation might be needed
   to inform middleboxes and proxies of the chosen path.
   Keep-alive messages may also be sent, as appropriate, to ensure NAT and
   firewall state is maintained, so the transient remains operational.

By encapsulating these four phases of communication establishment into the
PSI, Post Sockets aims to simplify application development.
It can provide reusable implementations of connection racing for TCP, to enable
happy eyeballs, that will be automatically used by all TCP clients, for example.
With appropriate callbacks to drive the rendezvous signalling as part of
resolving the remote, we believe a generic ICE implementation ought also to be
possible. This procedure can even be repeated fully or partially during a
connection to enable seamless hand-over and mobility within the network stack.
